Database configuration
-------------------------------------
To get the database set up, you need to follow a few steps:

1. Download the CS320_Derby project from the course website  (should already be in classpath, if not add it)

2. Change the JDBC URL to something that fits your platform

3. Run DerbyDatabase.java as a "Java Application" (this creates a new database)

4. That's about it.

Running it
-------------------------------------
1. Just use GWT
